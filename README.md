# Survival Pi

Survival Pi is (to be) the software component and hardware instructions for a 
low-cost, portable server node to serve as a communications hub for 
post-disaster survival and recovery.  Of course, it will also work out of the box pre-disaster.  

The hardware is based on the Raspberry Pi and the software is a LAMP stack configured and maintained using SaltStack.

This repository is for the install script and initial files.
